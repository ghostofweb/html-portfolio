    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Light Yagami. I’m 23 years old. I live in the Kanto section of Japan, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as a detective for the Japanese Task Force, and I get home everyday at 8PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11PM, and make sure to get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about 20 minutes o stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping in the morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know this is what brings me happiness. Although if I were to fight, I wouldn’t lose to anyone.</p>
